The Sorting Hat

I am the Sorting Hat
I know your every thought
I can see your heart and mind
And tell you where you ought

To go and learn and grow and thrive
Among your fellow peers
To find your place and make your mark
In your Hogwarts years

Will you be brave and bold and true
And fight for what is right?
Then Gryffindor is where you belong
With lions red and bright

Will you be smart and wise and keen
And seek for knowledge new?
Then Ravenclaw is where you belong
With eagles bronze and blue

Will you be loyal and kind and fair
And value friendship strong?
Then Hufflepuff is where you belong
With badgers yellow and black

Will you be cunning and clever and sly
And strive for power and fame?
Then Slytherin is where you belong
With serpents green and silver

So put me on and don't be shy
And don't be afraid to choose
For I am the Sorting Hat
And I will never lose.
