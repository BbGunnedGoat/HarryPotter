The Missing Wand

Luna Lovegood was in a panic. She had lost her wand somewhere in the castle, and she had no idea where to look for it. She had been using it to practice some new spells she had learned from The Quibbler, and she must have dropped it or left it behind somewhere. She retraced her steps, but she couldn't find it anywhere.

She decided to ask her friends for help. She found Harry, Ron and Hermione in the library, studying for their Defense Against the Dark Arts exam.

"Hi, Luna," Harry greeted her. "What's up?"

"I've lost my wand," Luna said, sounding distraught. "Have you seen it?"

"Your wand?" Hermione repeated. "No, I haven't. When did you last have it?"

"I don't remember exactly," Luna admitted. "I was trying some new spells in the corridor, and then I went to the Great Hall for lunch, and then I went to the greenhouses for Herbology, and then I went to the owlery to send a letter to my dad, and then I came here."

"That's a lot of places," Ron said. "Maybe you should ask Professor Flitwick. He might be able to help you locate it with a charm."

"Good idea," Luna said. "Thank you, Ron. I'll go see him right away."

She left the library and headed to the Charms classroom, hoping that Professor Flitwick would be there. She knocked on the door and heard a faint "Come in."

She opened the door and saw Professor Flitwick sitting at his desk, grading some papers.

"Hello, Miss Lovegood," he said, looking up at her with a smile. "What can I do for you?"

"Professor Flitwick, I've lost my wand," Luna said. "Can you help me find it?"

"Your wand?" Professor Flitwick repeated. "That's not good. How did you lose it?"

"I don't know," Luna said. "I was using it for some experiments, and then I forgot where I put it."

"Experiments?" Professor Flitwick asked, raising an eyebrow. "What kind of experiments?"

"Oh, just some spells I read about in The Quibbler," Luna said casually.

Professor Flitwick sighed. He knew that The Quibbler was a magazine full of nonsense and conspiracy theories, published by Luna's father.

"Miss Lovegood, you should be careful with what you read in that magazine," he said. "Some of those spells are very dangerous and unreliable."

"I know, but they're also very interesting and fun," Luna said. "Like the one that turns your hair into feathers, or the one that makes your voice sound like a duck's quack."

"Those sound harmless enough," Professor Flitwick said. "But what about the one that makes your nose grow like Pinocchio's, or the one that makes your ears flap like Dumbo's?"

"I haven't tried those yet," Luna said. "But they sound fun too."

Professor Flitwick shook his head.

"Miss Lovegood, please promise me that you won't try any more of those spells until you find your wand," he said. "They could have serious consequences if they go wrong."

"I promise," Luna said.

"Good," Professor Flitwick said. "Now, let me see if I can help you find your wand. Do you remember what kind of wood and core it has?"

"Yes," Luna said. "It's made of cherry wood and has a unicorn hair core."

"Very well," Professor Flitwick said. "That should make it easier to locate. Hold on a moment."

He took out his own wand and waved it over a map of Hogwarts that was hanging on the wall.

"Accio Luna's wand!" he said.

The map glowed briefly, and then a small dot appeared on it.

"There it is!" Professor Flitwick exclaimed. "Your wand is in the Room of Requirement!"

"The Room of Requirement?" Luna repeated. "What's that?"

"It's a magical room that appears when someone needs it," Professor Flitwick explained. "It can be anything you want it to be, as long as you know how to access it."

"How do I access it?" Luna asked.

"You have to walk past the wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy three times, thinking hard about what you need," Professor Flitwick said. "Then a door will appear, and you can enter the room."

"Thank you, Professor Flitwick!" Luna said gratefully. "You're very kind."

"Not at all, Miss Lovegood," Professor Flitwick said. "Now hurry up and get your wand before someone else finds it."

Luna nodded and ran out of the classroom, following the map to the seventh floor. She found the wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, who was trying to teach trolls to dance, and walked past it three times, thinking hard about her wand.

A door appeared on the wall, and Luna opened it. She entered the Room of Requirement, and gasped.

The room was filled with all kinds of objects, from furniture to books to clothes to toys. It looked like a giant storage room, or a museum, or a junkyard. Luna wondered how many people had used this room before, and what they had needed.

She looked around, trying to spot her wand among the clutter. She saw a broomstick, a telescope, a chess set, a guitar, a tiara, a sword, a cage, a mirror, a hat, a cloak, a necklace, a ring, a cup, a diary, a locket...

She stopped. She recognized the locket. It was the one that Harry had been looking for. The one that belonged to Voldemort.

She felt a sudden curiosity. She wanted to see what was inside it. She reached out and touched it.

The locket snapped open, and a voice hissed in her ear.

"Hello, Luna," it said. "I've been waiting for you."

Luna felt a cold shiver run down her spine. She tried to pull away from the locket, but it was too late. The voice continued.

"I know you, Luna," it said. "I know your secrets. I know your fears. I know your weaknesses."

Luna felt a wave of dread wash over her. She felt like she was drowning in darkness.

"What do you want?" she whispered.

"I want you to join me," the voice said. "I want you to serve me. I want you to give me your wand."

"No," Luna said. "Never."

"Yes," the voice said. "You will. You have no choice. You have no friends. You have no family. You have no hope."

"That's not true," Luna said. "I have friends. I have Harry, Ron and Hermione. I have Ginny and Neville. I have my dad."

"They don't care about you," the voice said. "They think you're weird. They think you're crazy. They think you're useless."

"That's not true," Luna said. "They like me. They respect me. They need me."

"They don't," the voice said. "They pity you. They mock you. They ignore you."

"That's not true," Luna said.

"It is," the voice said.

"It's not," Luna said.

"It is," the voice said.

"It's not," Luna said.

"It is," the voice said.

"It's not!" Luna shouted.

She felt something snap inside her. She felt a surge of anger and courage.

She grabbed the locket and threw it across the room.

"Shut up!" she yelled. "You're lying! You're evil! You're nothing!"

The locket hit the wall and fell to the floor with a clatter.

Luna felt a sudden relief. She felt like she had broken free from a nightmare.

She looked around and saw her wand lying on a table next to a pile of books.

She ran over and picked it up.

She felt a warm glow in her hand.

She smiled.

She had found her wand.

She had found herself.
