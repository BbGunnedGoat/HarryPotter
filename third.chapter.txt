The Birthday Surprise

Harry Potter was feeling miserable. It was his eleventh birthday, and he had received nothing but a coat hanger and a pair of socks from his aunt and uncle, who hated him and treated him like a slave. He had no friends, no presents, no cake, no fun. He wished he could escape from his miserable life and go somewhere else.

He was lying on his bed in the cupboard under the stairs, when he heard a loud thud on the door.

"Who's there?" he asked.

"Harry Potter," a deep voice boomed. "You have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

Harry gasped. He couldn't believe his ears. Was this some kind of joke?

He opened the door and saw a giant man standing there, holding a letter and a cake.

"Hello, Harry," the man said. "I'm Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. And this is for you."

He handed Harry the letter and the cake.

Harry opened the letter and read it.

"Dear Mr. Potter,

We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.

Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.

Yours sincerely,

Minerva McGonagall

Deputy Headmistress"

Harry couldn't believe his eyes. He was a wizard. He was going to a school for wizards. He had a future.

He looked at the cake. It was chocolate, with green icing and the words "Happy Birthday Harry" written on it.

He smiled. He had a present. He had a cake. He had a friend.

He hugged Hagrid and thanked him.

Hagrid smiled back and said, "You're welcome, Harry. And don't worry, I'll explain everything to you on the way."

He took Harry by the hand and led him out of the cupboard, past his stunned aunt and uncle, who were too scared to say anything.

Harry felt a surge of happiness and excitement.

He was leaving his miserable life behind.

He was going to Hogwarts.
